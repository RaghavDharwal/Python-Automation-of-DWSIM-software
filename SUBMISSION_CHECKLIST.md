# SUBMISSION CHECKLIST

## Before Submitting

Use this checklist to ensure your submission is complete.

### Required Files

- [ ] **run_screening.py** - Main Python script (REQUIRED)
- [ ] **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies (REQUIRED)
- [ ] **README.md** - Setup and execution instructions (REQUIRED)
- [ ] **results.csv** - Output file (will be generated when you run the script)

### Optional but Recommended Files

- [ ] **plot_results.py** - Plotting script (optional, but shows extra effort)
- [ ] **QUICKSTART.md** - Quick start guide
- [ ] **validate_setup.py** - Setup validation script
- [ ] **LICENSE** - License file
- [ ] **.gitignore** - Git ignore file

### Generated Files (After Running)

These files are created when you run the scripts:

- [ ] **results.csv** - Generated by `run_screening.py`
- [ ] **pfr_parametric_sweep.png** - Generated by `plot_results.py` (optional)
- [ ] **column_parametric_sweep.png** - Generated by `plot_results.py` (optional)
- [ ] **success_rate.png** - Generated by `plot_results.py` (optional)

### Pre-Submission Tests

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Validate setup
python validate_setup.py

# 2. Run a small test (quick)
python run_screening.py --pfr-volumes 1,2 --pfr-temps 500,600 --col-reflux 1.5,2.0 --col-stages 8,10

# 3. Check results.csv was created and has data
# Open results.csv and verify it contains simulation results

# 4. Generate plots (optional)
python plot_results.py

# 5. Verify plots were created (optional)
# Check that PNG files exist
```

### Code Quality Checks

- [ ] Code runs without errors on the test sweep
- [ ] results.csv is properly formatted with all required columns
- [ ] Failed cases are handled gracefully (status = "FAILED")
- [ ] README.md has clear instructions
- [ ] All required dependencies are listed in requirements.txt

### Submission Package Structure

Your compressed folder should contain:

```
Python-Automation-of-DWSIM-software/
├── run_screening.py           (Required)
├── requirements.txt           (Required)
├── README.md                  (Required)
├── results.csv               (Generated - include if available)
├── plot_results.py           (Optional)
├── QUICKSTART.md             (Optional)
├── validate_setup.py         (Optional)
├── LICENSE                   (Optional)
├── .gitignore               (Optional)
└── *.png                    (Optional - plots if generated)
```

### Final Steps

1. [ ] Run full parametric sweep:
   ```bash
   python run_screening.py
   ```

2. [ ] Generate plots:
   ```bash
   python plot_results.py
   ```

3. [ ] Review results.csv - ensure you have both PFR and COLUMN cases

4. [ ] Compress the folder:
   - Windows: Right-click → Send to → Compressed folder
   - Linux/Mac: `zip -r Python-Automation-of-DWSIM-software.zip Python-Automation-of-DWSIM-software/`

5. [ ] Upload to Google Drive

6. [ ] Get shareable link (set permissions to "Anyone with the link can view")

7. [ ] Submit link at: https://forms.gle/WFA3Wem6nZKu414UA

### Evaluation Criteria Coverage

Verify your solution addresses all criteria:

- [ ] **Correctness**: PFR and Column simulations run successfully
- [ ] **Robustness**: Failed cases handled gracefully with error messages
- [ ] **Parametric Sweep**: At least 2 variables swept for each model
- [ ] **Headless Execution**: No GUI interaction, fully automated
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Clean, well-structured, documented code
- [ ] **Documentation**: Clear README with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] **Results Format**: results.csv has all required KPI columns

### Notes

- **Don't include**: `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, or other temporary files
- **Do include**: All source files, documentation, and generated results
- **Testing**: Run on a fresh environment if possible to ensure setup instructions work
- **Size**: Compressed folder should be < 10 MB (excluding virtual environment)
